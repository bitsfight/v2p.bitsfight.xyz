# Terms of Service

Thanks for using Our App, your support directly sustains the development. This App has no venture capital or corporation backing it, we are trying to bring the best experience to users as a really small indie team.

## Changes to This Terms of Service

We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications via the Services. 

It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or via the Services, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Site or the Services anymore. 

Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
